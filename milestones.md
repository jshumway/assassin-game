[done] simulation

    this mile stone has been achieved when I can do a simulation of the full game, without involving external services like Twilio, and without real users playing. Simply a script that can generate a bunch of player profiles and have them run through a game. Many but not all of the game rules should be in place and testablly correct.

advanced simulation

    more game rules and better matching algorithms.

    * expire contracts?
    * multiple contracts
    * better assignment of contracts
    * match making and scoring
    * recognize killing sprees?
    * more fine grained control over the simulations

    this milestone has been met when all the remains to reach playable is to link up live services (Twilio, etc), (half) account creation and sign up, and other user facing features. the completion of this milestone signals that the first version of gameplay is in place and that the base_game.py and game.py interfaces have solidified (at least a little).

playable

    real players, real texts, can start a game using special admin functionality and have friends join and play a game of assassin. no user interface for creating games yet.
