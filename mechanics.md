bloodlust

    you have been tracking a target for a long time, their demise seems sweeter with each passing second.

    after waiting long enough to kill a target, they become worth slightly more points

    this is negitive feedback that prevents people far behind from getting even farther behind. it also adds a new wave of motivation when a killer has been having trouble with a target

sated

    the recent blood spilled has left you sated. you feel content to lay low for a while and act more cautiously.

    right after a contract completetion the next contract completion is worth slightly less.

    negative feedback that prevents players from pulling super far ahead in a short time.

    note that the negative effects of sated are counteracted by killing sprees. probably

sated and bloodlust are meant to bring less dedicated players a little closer to more dedicated players. Their effects should be on a sliding scale so that waiting an additional hour isn't the difference between a 10 point kill and a 15 point kill.

frenzy period

    at the beginning of the game, maybe for the first week or so, contracts expire more quickly, and assigned more quickly, players go into bloodlust more quickly, and fall out of a sated state more quickly.

    this mechanic is meant to take advantage of players' excitement when a game of assassin starts up, rewarding the participation of players while everyone is still focused and has a chance to win.
